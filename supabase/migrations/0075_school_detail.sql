-- 0075 — You could not open a school
--
-- Phase 2a of docs/SUPER-ADMIN-DESIGN.md. The console listed eight fields per
-- school and that was every fact it held about a customer. There was no way to
-- answer "what is going on at Al Qalam School?"
--
-- THE MOST USEFUL THING HERE IS THE READINESS CHECKLIST
--
-- A school that has paid and never used the software looks identical, in the
-- list, to one that runs on it daily — until it does not renew. And the commonest
-- reason a school stalls is not reluctance, it is being stuck one step in:
-- 0066 found that no school could create a fee head at all, so the Fee Structure
-- grid was an empty list with a Save button and every school was stuck at the
-- same place with no way to say so.
--
-- So readiness is computed, in the order a school actually has to do things, and
-- the first unfinished item is the phone call worth making. A school stuck at
-- "no fee heads" is one conversation away from being a customer for years, and
-- today there is no way to know they are stuck.
--
-- WHERE THE LINE IS ON WHAT THIS EXPOSES
--
-- This function reads tenant tables as the operator, with no support session
-- open, which is a deliberate narrow exception to the rule tenant_isolation.sql
-- TEST 5 defends. So the line has to be stated rather than assumed:
--
--   IT RETURNS       counts, dates, and the school's own staff/login list —
--                    "412 pupils, last payment Tuesday, four logins, the
--                    accountant has never signed in". These are facts about the
--                    CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP and the operator needs them to run a
--                    business.
--
--   IT NEVER RETURNS a child's name, a guardian, a family, a mark, an individual
--                    payment, or a parent's phone number. Nothing about a person
--                    the school serves.
--
-- For those, open a support visit (0074): read-only, logged, and shown to the
-- school. The distinction is the whole point — "how many pupils" is business
-- information, "which pupils" is the school's own affair, and an operator who
-- wants the second should have to leave a record saying why.
--
-- tenant_isolation.sql asserts both halves of that: TEST 5 that the platform
-- role still reaches no tenant TABLE directly, and TEST 9 that this function's
-- output contains no pupil name even when the school is full of them.
--
-- Re-runnable.
